				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor Henry Golding will be playing Nick Young in the movie &#8216;Crazy Rich Asians&#8217;, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/crazy-rich-asians-lands-male-lead-988732">according to Hollywood Reporter</a>:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The story follows Rachel Chu (Wu), an American-born Chinese economics professor, who travels to her boyfriend Nick&#8217;s (Golding) hometown of Singapore for his best friend&#8217;s wedding. Before long, his secret is out: Nick is from a family that is impossibly wealthy, he&#8217;s perhaps the most eligible bachelor in Asia, and every single woman in his ultra-rarefied social class is incredibly jealous of Rachel and wants to bring her down.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Michelle Yeoh <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/crazy-rich-asians-adds-michelle-yeoh-981172" target="_blank">is attached to play </a>Nick&#8217;s controlling mother who disapproves of Rachel.</em></p>
<p>So who is Henry Golding? The article states that he is half white on his father&#8217;s side, and his mother is Malaysian:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Golding, whose father is from England and his mother from the Iban tribe in Sarawak, Malaysia, is a true discovery. He is currently based in Singapore after growing up in London, and has never been featured in a film, but has experience hosting for TV travel shows. He is represented by management company FLY Entertainment in Singapore.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naver, the biggest tech company in South Korea, has brought on Han Seong-sook as its first female CEO, <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2017/03/19/south-korean-tech-giant-has-its-first-female-ceo/#5602eded7d0a">according to Forbes.</a></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Han, who led search quality and general management at  Naver, is also the first non-engineer to lead the tech company. Seen as rational and passionate, the 50-year-old is said to know all 2,400 employees by name. Her alertness to the evolving demands of the tech industry apparently helped the tech giant find growth and global momentum.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>She stresses the importance of Naver forming a sense of responsibility and mission to become a technology leader. She is leading efforts to step up support for creators and small businesses, vowing to provide user-friendly services and step-by-step programs.</em></p>
<p>The CEO also credits her success to the fact that she&#8217;s a workaholic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>She admits that being a workaholic has helped her get where she is today. With no husband or children, she is said to be married to her job. When the magazine asked how she was able to continue innovating for 27 years, she joked, “Well, because I’m single? I think it’s important to have nothing else to do but work.”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is Dr. Jianxiong Xiao. He&#8217;s quite an accomplished man.</p>
<p>For starters, he received a PhD from MIT, then became a professor of computer science at Princeton. Then he left Princeton to become the CEO of AutoX, a self driving car company that is competing against the likes of Google and Uber.</p>
<p>His team of 20 employees, mostly engineers, is quite small, but he believes they have a significant advantage: they have a knowledge of computer vision and artificial intelligence that the other big companies simply can&#8217;t match. In other words, he saying they&#8217;re actually smarter than the competition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/autox-ceo-jianxiong-xiao-interview-2017-3">According to Business Insider,</a></span> their team was able to build a prototype in just six months, using their own technology. This is a big bonus because they don&#8217;t need to rely on anyone else, and that&#8217;s a good way to avoid being sued over copyright/IP infringement. In fact, the cameras that they used for their prototype only costed $50 each, and were bought from Best Buy.</p>
<p>Xiao eventually wants to create a product that can be used by existing car manufacturers (like an add-on), rather than manufacturing whole cars like Tesla.</p>
<p>Check out the video of the AutoX prototype in action:</p>
