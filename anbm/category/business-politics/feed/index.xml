<p>“Valor With Honor” is an independent documentary film based on over 35 oral histories of Japanese American WW2 veterans. These heroic veterans served in the Japanese American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. The 442nd is the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of the United States Armed Forces. The Japanese American 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and the Military Intelligence Service were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal (2012) for outstanding service to the country in WW2.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naver, the biggest tech company in South Korea, has brought on Han Seong-sook as its first female CEO, <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2017/03/19/south-korean-tech-giant-has-its-first-female-ceo/#5602eded7d0a">according to Forbes.</a></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Han, who led search quality and general management at  Naver, is also the first non-engineer to lead the tech company. Seen as rational and passionate, the 50-year-old is said to know all 2,400 employees by name. Her alertness to the evolving demands of the tech industry apparently helped the tech giant find growth and global momentum.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>She stresses the importance of Naver forming a sense of responsibility and mission to become a technology leader. She is leading efforts to step up support for creators and small businesses, vowing to provide user-friendly services and step-by-step programs.</em></p>
<p>The CEO also credits her success to the fact that she&#8217;s a workaholic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>She admits that being a workaholic has helped her get where she is today. With no husband or children, she is said to be married to her job. When the magazine asked how she was able to continue innovating for 27 years, she joked, “Well, because I’m single? I think it’s important to have nothing else to do but work.”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is Dr. Jianxiong Xiao. He&#8217;s quite an accomplished man.</p>
<p>For starters, he received a PhD from MIT, then became a professor of computer science at Princeton. Then he left Princeton to become the CEO of AutoX, a self driving car company that is competing against the likes of Google and Uber.</p>
<p>His team of 20 employees, mostly engineers, is quite small, but he believes they have a significant advantage: they have a knowledge of computer vision and artificial intelligence that the other big companies simply can&#8217;t match. In other words, he saying they&#8217;re actually smarter than the competition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/autox-ceo-jianxiong-xiao-interview-2017-3">According to Business Insider,</a></span> their team was able to build a prototype in just six months, using their own technology. This is a big bonus because they don&#8217;t need to rely on anyone else, and that&#8217;s a good way to avoid being sued over copyright/IP infringement. In fact, the cameras that they used for their prototype only costed $50 each, and were bought from Best Buy.</p>
<p>Xiao eventually wants to create a product that can be used by existing car manufacturers (like an add-on), rather than manufacturing whole cars like Tesla.</p>
<p>Check out the video of the AutoX prototype in action:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeremy Liew is a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. His job is straightforward: find new and hot startup companies before everyone else does.</p>
<p>So when a little known app called Snapchat surfaced in 2012, he was intrigued. According to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-lightspeeds-jeremy-liew-became-snapchats-first-investor-2017-2">Business Insider</a>, it all started when his VC partner brought it to his attention:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When Liew first found Snapchat, the disappearing photo app had fewer than 100,000 installs. Liew&#8217;s VC partner, Barry Eggers, had seen it on his teenage daughter&#8217;s phone. She told her father there were only three apps high school kids were using: Angry Birds, Instagram, and Snapchat. Liew was familiar with the first two. But he had never heard of Snapchat.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The comment was enough to pique Liew&#8217;s curiosity. He made it his mission to find out who was behind the mysterious app.</em></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t an easy process. Liew had to do a lot of detective work on Google until he was able to locate Evan Spiegel, the co-founder of Snapchat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Liew did a Google search and came up dry. No articles had been written about Snapchat. There was no contact information on the startup&#8217;s website except for a generic email address. Liew messaged it and heard nothing back. Liew looked up the company on LinkedIn and sent a message.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Again, there was no response. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Determined, Liew did a WhoIs lookup on the domain name, Snapchat.com. It had been registered by Toyopa Group, the former parent company of Snapchat. Spiegel had named it after the street his father lived on, Toyopa Drive.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Liew did a Google search for Toyopa Group and found Evan Spiegel&#8217;s name. He was a student at Stanford, where Liew had also gone to school. Liew was able to message him on Facebook through the Stanford alumni network.</em></p>
<p>Eventually Liew was able to successful get in contact with Spiegel. Apparently the only reason Spiegel responded to his message was because Liew had a photo of President Obama in his profile picture:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Liew later asked Spiegel why he returned the Facebook request and none of his other messages.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;It was because you had President Obama in your profile picture,&#8221; Spiegel said. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s serendipity involved in all this stuff,&#8221; Liew said.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-691" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jeremyobama-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jeremyobama-300x225.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jeremyobama-768x576.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jeremyobama.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Liew&#8217;s company was able to get in their investment, and today Snapchat filed to go public. Thanks to Jeremy&#8217;s tenacity and persistence, he&#8217;s a whole lot richer.</p>
