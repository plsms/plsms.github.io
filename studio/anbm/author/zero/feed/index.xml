				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eliza Romero is a fashion photographer and blogger who has written an article called <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://aestheticdistance.com/blog//dear-asian-women-im-calling-you-out-on-this-one">Dear Asian Women, I&#8217;m Calling You Out On This One. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In her post, she says that <em>&#8220;every time an Asian woman complains that only white guys want to date her and that white guys fetishize Asian women, it usually turns out that she herself has only dated white guys. Interesting how that works, right?&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1296" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eliza2-300x182.png" alt="" width="300" height="182" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eliza2-300x182.png 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eliza2-768x465.png 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eliza2-1024x620.png 1024w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eliza2.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She also a few theories on the dynamics of Asian women living in Western society:</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Asian women experience a much greater amount of privilege in a white-dominated society than Asian men, specifically lighter-skinned East Asian women. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>2. Asian women have been societally influenced to think that white men are more attractive than Asian men because western media has emasculated Asian men.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>3. Certain Asian women just don&#8217;t want to admit that they have a white guy fetish so they put the blame on the dudes. </strong></em></p>
<p>I certainly don&#8217;t disagree her there. Her theories are not new, and have been echoed for many years around various Asian activist groups/platforms. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s always refreshing to hear an Asian woman reaffirm it.</p>
<p>She concludes by saying:</p>
<p><em><strong>Beauty is a social construct that is amplified by pop culture. Many times, the same women who make these complaints about white men having an Asian fetish are the same women who decry the lack of diversity in fashion and entertainment. I&#8217;d like those women to zoom out and take a look at their own personal choices.</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Johnnie Walker is a brand of Scotch whisky that originated in Scotland. In what seems to be a contrived effort to reach out to Chinese consumers, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.facebook.com/JohnnieWalkerUS/videos/10154841080192247">they released a commercial on their Facebook page</a></span> that features a white man, his female Chinese fiancé, and her obviously disapproving Chinese father.</p>
<p>The problem with this commercial is that it follows a pattern that we&#8217;ve seen over and over again in TV shows, films, and commercials that go something like this: 1) White man falls in love with Asian female, 2) White man and Asian female must overcome cultural barriers in order to be together and 3) Asian men are asexual, patriarchal, oppressive villains who act as another barrier that the white man and Asian female must also overcome.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t the media ever just portray normal Asian men with Asian women in relationships together? What about an Asian men with white women? It&#8217;s because these images would not fit into the narrative that western socierty wants us to see.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the commercial itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1182" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker2-300x286.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="286" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker2-300x286.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker2-768x733.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker2.jpg 943w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1183" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker3-300x287.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="287" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker3-300x287.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker3-768x735.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker3.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two of them are at the dinner table eating. The woman is showing flash cards with Chinese characters on them, trying to teach him the Chinese language. Notice how the white man is holding chopsticks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1184" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker4-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="285" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker4-300x285.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker4-768x731.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker4.jpg 946w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1185" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker5-300x287.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="287" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker5-300x287.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker5-768x735.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker5.jpg 941w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then see him trying to become more Asian by going for a brisk job through Chinatown and doing his homework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1186" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker6-300x288.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="288" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker6-300x288.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker6-768x736.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker6.jpg 939w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1187" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker7-300x287.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="287" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker7-300x287.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker7-768x735.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker7.jpg 941w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1194" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker8-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="285" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker8-300x285.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker8-768x730.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker8.jpg 947w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s the day of the wedding. The father-in-law, named Mr. Fong, appears to be cold and calculating. The white man approaches him and says &#8220;Ni hao, Mr. Fong.&#8221; Oh boy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1195" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker9-300x286.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="286" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker9-300x286.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker9-768x732.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker9.jpg 944w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1196" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker10-300x282.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker10-300x282.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker10-768x721.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker10.jpg 959w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He gives Mr. Fong a bottle of Blue Label whiskey while saying &#8220;Please accept this gift&#8221; in horribly butchered Mandarin. Mr. Fong seems to smile approvingly. (<em>Why Mr. Fong, why??</em>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1197" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker11-300x286.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="286" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker11-300x286.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker11-768x732.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker11.jpg 944w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1198" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker12-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker12-300x283.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker12-768x725.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker12.jpg 954w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1199" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker13-300x288.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="288" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker13-300x288.jpg 300w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker13-768x738.jpg 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/johnniewalker13.jpg 936w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The Chinese woman peeks through the door, happy that the exchange seems to have gone well. However, she is met with an angry glare from her father. The happy look on her face quickly vanishes as she closes the door and leaves. Are we supposed to get the feeling that being with a white man is more liberating and free than being with an Asian man? It sure seems that way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the theme of &#8220;White man falls in love with Asian woman, must defeat the evil, oppressive Asian man&#8221; is nothing new. It&#8217;s been done over and over again in countless western martial arts tv shows and movies. It&#8217;s sad to see a modern commercial continue to embrace and reinforce tired cliches and stereotypes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A video about a white male English teacher in China talking about how easy it is for him to have sex with Chinese woman is garnering a lot of attention.</p>
<p>The man claims that his name is Jack and that he used to be a farmer in America before coming to China. After losing his job, his friends suggest that he move to China, and he did so in 2013.</p>
<p>Naturally, it didn&#8217;t take long before he started to brag about his sexual conquests.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain, &#8220;Everyone respects foreigners. People want to take pictures with us, and the key is that Chinese girls are pretty cute. They are so beautiful and they are really into foreigners, so it&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then goes on to talk about how easy it is for him to get one night stands. As if to prove his point, the video shows him approaching random women at restaurants and cafes and exchanging contact information with them.</p>
<p>The video also mentions that Jack has hooked up with 200 Chinese women.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, white male English teachers have become synonymous with &#8220;looking-for-easy-sex-with-Asian-women-because-I-can&#8217;t-get-any-back-in-my-home-country.&#8221; Thankfully, more and more people are waking up to this fact, and a video like this is adding fuel to the fire.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeremy Liew is a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. His job is straightforward: find new and hot startup companies before everyone else does.</p>
<p>So when a little known app called Snapchat surfaced in 2012, he was intrigued. According to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-lightspeeds-jeremy-liew-became-snapchats-first-investor-2017-2">Business Insider</a>, it all started when his VC partner brought it to his attention:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When Liew first found Snapchat, the disappearing photo app had fewer than 100,000 installs. Liew&#8217;s VC partner, Barry Eggers, had seen it on his teenage daughter&#8217;s phone. She told her father there were only three apps high school kids were using: Angry Birds, Instagram, and Snapchat. Liew was familiar with the first two. But he had never heard of Snapchat.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The comment was enough to pique Liew&#8217;s curiosity. He made it his mission to find out who was behind the mysterious app.</em></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t an easy process. Liew had to do a lot of detective work on Google until he was able to locate Evan Spiegel, the co-founder of Snapchat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Liew did a Google search and came up dry. No articles had been written about Snapchat. There was no contact information on the startup&#8217;s website except for a generic email address. Liew messaged it and heard nothing back. Liew looked up the company on LinkedIn and sent a message.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Again, there was no response. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Determined, Liew did a WhoIs lookup on the domain name, Snapchat.com. It had been registered by Toyopa Group, the former parent company of Snapchat. Spiegel had named it after the street his father lived on, Toyopa Drive.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Liew did a Google search for Toyopa Group and found Evan Spiegel&#8217;s name. He was a student at Stanford, where Liew had also gone to school. Liew was able to message him on Facebook through the Stanford alumni network.</em></p>
<p>Eventually Liew was able to successful get in contact with Spiegel. Apparently the only reason Spiegel responded to his message was because Liew had a photo of President Obama in his profile picture:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Liew later asked Spiegel why he returned the Facebook request and none of his other messages.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 39 year old American man named Joshua Robinson has been sent to 4 years in prison for having sex with two underage girls. He was also caught with 321 films containing child pornography featuring children as young as two years old.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/trainer-jailed-for-sex-with-minors-making-obscene-videos">The Straits Times</a>, this is believed to be the largest number of such films seized from a single person in Singapore:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The court heard that Robinson got to know the first teen, who was then 15 years old, on a dating website. They met on Sept 11, 2013, and went to his home at the Riverwalk Apartments in Upper Circular Road, where he filmed himself having unprotected sex with her on his mobile phone.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>He had sex at least two more times with the girl after this, and he filmed both encounters.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>He met his second victim, also 15 years old at the time, via another website in early 2015. Robinson told the girl he had a fetish for young girls in uniform, Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Lai said in court.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The DPP added: &#8220;He told her, &#8216;I have wanted to find (girls) as young as possible. I think 13 would be ultimate&#8217;.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>When the pair met on June 23, 2015, he told her to be in her school uniform. They met at Clarke Quay MRT station before going to his home, where they had unprotected sex and he filmed the act without her consent.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>When she left his apartment, the court heard she broke into tears, had a &#8220;mental breakdown&#8221; and told her parents, who alerted the police.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Two days later, officers seized his computer and portable hard drive, where they found 5,902 obscene films, of which 321 contained child pornography.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>About a month later, while he was out on bail, he targeted a third girl.</em></p>
<p>Why does Asia seem to attract these type of men?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man named Nick Vedovi is in hot water for calling an Asian woman a &#8220;chink&#8221; and &#8220;cunt&#8221; when she wouldn&#8217;t reply to his text messages.</p>
<p>The issue was brought to light when a former friend of Vedovi received text messages from the woman. The friend, named Kevin, then proceeded to share the messages to Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-601" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi4-174x300.png" alt="" width="326" height="562" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi4-174x300.png 174w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi4-768x1325.png 768w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi4-594x1024.png 594w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi4.png 908w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kevin writes, &#8220;I met this guy in college and he seemed like a decent guy, he was nice, friendly, etc. over the weekend, he matched a friend of mine on tinder and they exchanged messages. When she didn’t respond immediately, he lost it and left a bunch of nasty messages. I called him out on it, he denied, and he proceeded to block me on all social media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sexism and racism takes many forms and it cannot be tolerated. As a man and POC, we can&#8217;t let this stand,&#8221; Kevin concludes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-598" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi1-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="513" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi1-169x300.jpg 169w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi1.jpg 719w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-599" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi2-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="513" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi2-169x300.jpg 169w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi2.jpg 719w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-600" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi3-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="515" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi3-169x300.jpg 169w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi3-575x1024.jpg 575w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NickVedovi3.jpg 719w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages from Vedovi are indeed disturbing. He tries to get her to join him for a drink in the evening. She initially agrees, but when Vedovi gives him her address, she becomes skeptical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you normally give your address so freely?&#8221; she writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a 6&#8217;2&#8243; guy that works out. What&#8217;s going to happen?&#8221; he responds.</p>
<p>When she stopped replying to his text messages, Vedovi became aggressive. &#8220;Ugh you chinks are the samee such a waste of time. next time don&#8217;t give our your number dumb cunt,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>This begs the question, just how many white men who date Asian women secretly view them as &#8220;chinks&#8221; and &#8220;cunts&#8221;?</p>

<p>A man by the name of Bryan Reynolds posted on Facebook about how he had sex with 170 women in Taiwan without a condom.</p>
<p>He then proceeds to make a backhanded insult at Asian men by saying that &#8220;Taiwanese girls barely get nailed anyways. Most are like virgins. Lol.&#8221;</p>
<p>When another user suggests that his sexcapades were the result of him paying for prostitutes, Mr. Reynolds replies by saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t pay. Im white. Lol.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then ends his bragging session by saying &#8220;Grab them by the pussy. Haha. Im not a liberal&#8221;.</p>
<p>To the ladies in Taiwan, be warned. A man such as Mr. Reynolds is unfortunately too common, and if they try to use their whiteness as a way to get you into bed, get out as quickly as you can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An upset Filipino woman took to Facebook when her Australian ex abandoned her and their daughter.</p>
<p>The woman, who appears to be in her 20&#8217;s, wrote on the social media site, <em>&#8220;To my ex, if you are back in this site where we met, I just want you to know that losing you is not a lost. It&#8217;s a gain actually. You dumped a very beautiful angel and I will never regret having her. I am so blessed to have her. Thank you for wasting my two years with you. I thought you were different. I won&#8217;t go after you for child support for KARMA is there.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-783" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17098622_10154599383237261_8658660642027881502_n-233x300.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="300" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17098622_10154599383237261_8658660642027881502_n-233x300.jpg 233w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17098622_10154599383237261_8658660642027881502_n.jpg 524w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></em></p>
<p>Her ex, named Steve John, is much older white male who appears to be in his 50&#8217;s or 60&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In another post, the woman wrote, &#8220;To my ex again, one day you will meet someone who can never put with your s***ty attitude. I know now, this is how you play games.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-784" src="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103321_10154599384082261_3504035292581239220_n-190x300.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="300" srcset="/anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103321_10154599384082261_3504035292581239220_n-190x300.jpg 190w, /anbm/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17103321_10154599384082261_3504035292581239220_n.jpg 508w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px" /></p>
<p>She continues by revealing that John had another child, a son, that he had also abandoned and left for her to care for: <em>&#8220;I hope the immigration will deport you back to Australia not because my daughter is your second child that you abandoned here in Philippines but because you are 3 years overstayed here. Pls ladies in this group, if you ever come across to this man&#8217;s profile, please stay away from it because I am pretty sure he will do the same. He abandoned his and his newborn daughter with me. </em></p>
<p>She concludes by saying, &#8220;Wow<em> Steve, your relationship with your son&#8217;s mom lasted 11 months and we lasted 2 years. Stupid me for believing all your lies but it&#8217;s too late to regret meeting you now. I got a beautiful daughter and I love her more than anything else in this world.&#8221;</em></p>
